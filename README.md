# Honors-Thesis-Applying-Machine-Learning-To-Denoise-HoloOcean-Simulated-Sonar-Images
This is a project for Spencer Ashford's BYU Undergraduate Honors Thesis: Applying Machine Learning Methods to Denoise HoloOcean Simulated Profiling Sonar Images

Dataset:
The dataset consists of over 1000 image pairs generated from simulated sonar imagary using BYU's Holoocean underwater robotics simulator.  Each image pair consists of a "noisy" and "noiseless" image, corresponding to a single profiling sonar output with simulated noise either added or not respectively.

The training script consists of a python notebook meant to work with Google Colab and make use of their hardware acceleration capabilities.  It should be possible to use other IDEs and to change the hardware accelerator as needed, though this will require individual adaptation.
